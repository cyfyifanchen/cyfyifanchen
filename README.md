 🤔 The language is CSS, it's easy to read, it's impossible to read, don't ask why.
  
 🤨 The editor is Vim, often spend too much time on hjkl and forget other commands.

 😑 The city is Shanghai, it has the most coffee shops, but very few places sell bagels.

 🤩 The food is burger, I wanted to go with pizza, but burger comes with fries.

 🇨🇳 The music is Jay Chou, believe it or not, mandarin pop is dope as heck.

 🙏 The anime is Dragon Ball, let Vegeta defeat Goku once, just once, please.
  
 🧪 The show is Breaking Bad, stop screwing things up, Jessie.

 🙃 The game is dota2, Void chrono teammates is what I do the best.

 😭 The car is JDM, 2009 R35, 2023 still R35, I wanna see R36 before the end of my life.
